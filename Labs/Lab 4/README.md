I used a recursive swapping approach. First, check if the root node is null because this means we are on a leaf node and we cannot proceed to its left or right children. The swapping approach I took was to swap the root's children first and move level-by-level. Then, go down the left subtree and swap its children. Do the same with the right subtree. Proceed to the next level. To do this, I used recursion and set the current root's left child to a call of invertTree with the root's right child. Then, do vice versa with the right child. Lastly, I return the root, which would be the current root, and in the end, would be the inverted tree's root. This would take O(n) time complexity.
