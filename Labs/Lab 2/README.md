The first check is if the strings' lengths are not the same. By definition of an anagram, this would automatically mean string t is not an anagram of string s, and we can simply return false. If it passes this check, create two hashmaps, one for each string, in which the key is each character and the value is always 1 (use a loop for this). Finally, return if both hashmaps are equal or not. If both hashmaps are equal, this means all the characters of the strings are the same, which follows the definition of an anagram.
