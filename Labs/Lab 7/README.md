The approach used is the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. The first step is to convert the graph to an adjacency matrix. Fill the adjacency matrix with large values and then populate the matrix with edge weights. Then, deploy the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices. Lastly, we count the number of reachable cities for each city and update the result variable accordingly. Return this variable. This approach would be an O(V^3) time complexity and O(V^2) space complexity.
