The first step is to create a hashmap for the input array with the element index as the key and the value as the difference between the target and the element. Thus, the hashmap would contain a group of two numbers whose sum adds up to the target. The next step is to find a pair of key and value that are both contained in the input array. To check if the value is contained in the array, we can check if the value is less than the length of the array. If the value is contained in the array, we can conclude that the key and value are the result (since the key is the index of the element that is known to be contained in the array).  The final step is to return a new array containing the key and value, which are the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target. This method is valid since it is given that we can assume there is exactly one solution.
