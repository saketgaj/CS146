The approach I used is an In-order Traversal to traverse the elements and add to a list, and then to check if the list is sorted in ascending order. Since the In-Order Traversal confirms that it is a valid BST, we can use that method. The first step is to create a helper method that traverses through the tree and populates a list. Then, loop through the list and check if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element. If anywhere the condition fails, return false. If all checks pass, then finally after the loop, return true, meaning it is a valid BST.
