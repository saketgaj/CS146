I used the BFS algorithm to traverse through the tree level by level from left to right. BFS algorithm traverses and adds the elements into a queue. I remove elements from this queue for every level. Until there are no elements left in the queue, maintain a sublist and remove a node from the queue, and add it to the sublist. Then, add its left and right children to the queue. Before doing this, check if the current node is not null, because this would help avoid NullPointer Exceptions. Then, add the sublist to the result list. Make sure to check if the sublist is not null, so we don't have an extra empty sublist. Finally, return the result list.
