The first step is to convert the uppercase letters to lowercase and "filter" out the non-alphanumeric characters. We do this by converting the string to lowercase, looping through this string, and building a new string that only contains the characters that are a letter or digit. The next step is to check if the string is a palindrome or not. The first check is simply if the length is 1 or less because this is automatically considered a palindrome, and checking this can avoid the loop/index out-of-bound errors. For lengths greater than 1, we can use 2 pointers, one that goes from the start to the end and one from the end to the start. We move these pointers, using a loop, until the characters at the pointers aren't the same or the pointers meet in the middle. Whenever the characters aren't the same, we can return false, as this means the string is not a palindrome. If the pointers meet in the middle, then the string is a palindrome, since the characters are the same from both sides(pointers). Return true.
