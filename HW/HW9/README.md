The approach I used is a simple BST search approach and I drew out an example tree to work out the logic. We can assume a node to be a child of itself as given in the instructions. If there is a split between p and q, then the parent node of both would be the LCA. You create a loop until you find the LCA. Maintain the current node because this is what you will return. The first check is to see if both p and q are smaller values than current node, because this means both of them are on the left side of the current node. Move the current node as such. The next check is to check if both p and q are greater values than current node, because this means both of them are on the right side of the current node. Move the current node as such. You would reach the last check if there is a split between p and q, meaning we have found the LCA. Return the current node.
