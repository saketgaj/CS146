My approach is to create 2 arrays: one for the start of the intervals, and one for the end of the intervals and move pointers to manage the intervals. The first step would be to sort both of these arrays. The next step is to keep moving the pointer of the start array until it reaches its last element (use a loop). For each move, compare the elements at the start pointer and end pointer: if the start is less than the end, you increment the number of servers and move the start pointer. Otherwise, you decrement the number of servers and move the end pointer. Finally, return the number of servers after the loop exists.
