The approach I used is an MST and the union-find algorithm. I had to research and learn about the union-find algorithm. The union-find algorithm works by maintaining a collection of disjoint sets, using union and find operations to merge lists and determine the representative element of each list, respectively. The union operation merges 2 lists while considering the most optimal rank and paths. The find operation finds the root of the list using the paths. The first step is to initialize the arrays that track the parent nodes and rank of the houses in the union-find. Then, convert the list of wells and pipes into a list of connections which are sorted by the costs. To ensure no cycles are created, iterate through the list of connections and use the union method/operation of the union-find algorithm. I used the union-find algorithm to account for both direct well connections and pipe connections between houses and calculate the total cost and return it as the result. This would be the minimum cost for water supply.
