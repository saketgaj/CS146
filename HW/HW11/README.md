I used a DFS algorithm approach. This algorithm requires the use of recursion to fill the indexes of the matrix with the new color. I used a helped method to implement the recursive portion of this algorithm. The first step is to check if the index is not out of bounds and is the same color as the source. Then, do recursion on the top, bottom, left, and right of the current index.
